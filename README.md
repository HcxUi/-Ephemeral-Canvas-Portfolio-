# Ephemeral Canvas Portfolio

This is a unique portfolio website designed to provide a one-of-a-kind visual experience for every visitor. The background visuals are generated in real-time using p5.js, ensuring that the aesthetic is always changing and never exactly repeatable.

## Concept

The "Ephemeral Canvas" aims to create an 'expensive' and exclusive feel through sophisticated, minimalist design paired with complex, beautiful generative art.

## Files

-   `index.html`: The main HTML structure.
-   `style.css`: CSS for styling the page and its elements.
-   `sketch.js`: The p5.js code responsible for the generative visuals.

## Running

Simply open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Ensure you have an internet connection for the p5.js library to be loaded from the CDN.

## Customization

-   Portfolio content (About, Projects, Contact) can be added to `index.html`.
-   The visual style and layout can be modified in `style.css`.
-   The core generative art logic is in `sketch.js`.
